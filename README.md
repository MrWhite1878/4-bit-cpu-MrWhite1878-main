# Lab 6 - CPU Design
Make sure to read all instructions carefully, and place all required deliverables inside of this repository BEFORE the due date. Good luck!
This repository **must** contain the archived Quartus project (.qar) file. You should not use this repository as your project directory; instead, have your Lab 6 project directory somewhere else on your local machine, and then archive and upload it to the repository when you are finished. There should only be **one** archive file with all necessary files inside of the project (VHDL and BDFs).

Ensure you have uploaded the PDF of your lab report into the repository before submitting, and you have submitted the link on Canvas.

Check the calendar and the Canvas page for the deadline.
